# MAGNETIUM
This mod adds magnets and their components to Minecraft. It's a very vanilla-friendly mod that allows players to collect dropped items within a specific range.

## Versions
For now, only the version for Minecraft 1.21.11 is available as a pre-compiled release here on GitHub. However, the source code for all versions from 1.21 to 1.21.11 is available, so you can compile the mod for your desired version yourself.
